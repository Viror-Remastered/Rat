# Rat
  This is the main source code repository for Rat. It contains a script language interpreter(Virtual Machine).
    - It is an experimental project now. If there is anything wrong, please tell us in the Issue region. We will fix it as soon as possible.

  ## about Rat
  - **Simple :** You don't need to create any complicated environment to run a Rat project, just create a .ra file, and give it to the micro-interpreter!
  
  - **Succinct Syntax:** We will never add anything unnecessary or complex to the syntax, like too many reserved words. (We have had enough of difficult languages!)
  If you have any ideas with new or better syntax, please tell us in the Issues region!

  ## Implementing
  We use C++ to implement this language.
